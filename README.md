# My Personal Website

## Purpose
This website's purpose is to provide me a way to have a better online presence.  It's something I've been meaning to do for quite a long time, and have only just gotten around to.  Whoever is reading this, I hope you like it.

## Tech Stack
As this is just a static website, there is no associated backend to it. 

Frontend: React (Javascript flavor).  I didn't feel like going through the effort of hooking up Typescript, even though that is my preference.

CI/CD: Github Actions.  I wanted to learn something new and haven't played with this before.

Hosting: Azure Static Web App.  I wanted to get a bit more familiar with the Azure interface, since I've mainly only touched AWS.
